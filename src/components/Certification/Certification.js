               This course provided me with a solid foundation in web development, covering the core technologies needed to create and manage websites: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

During the course, I gained practical experience in building responsive, interactive websites, learning how to structure web pages with HTML, style them with CSS, and make them dynamic with JavaScript. This certification reflects my commitment to expanding my skills in web development and my readiness to apply these techniques in future projects.
