By leveraging sensor data such as currents, temperatures, and joint speeds, the goal is to predict if a protective stop will occur within the next 10 time units. The project is part of a predictive maintenance initiative to reduce unplanned downtimes. Various models, including LSTM, GRU, RNN, SVM, and Transformer, are trained and compared to predict these stops. The best-performing model, LSTM, captures long-term dependencies despite being computationally intensive. The models are deployed via a Flask API and containerized using Docker for production use."
